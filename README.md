# Introduction
Rule of Score Four : Connect Four with gravity on 4x4x4 3D board.

Best result I have found before training KataGo: https://tum-csc.github.io/c43d/

# Results
Score Four : **Probably the first player wins**
Conjecture of Score N with N>=5: **The first player wins if N is odd; The second player wins if N is even;**   

There is no technical difficulty in solving Score Four strictly (by combining KataGo with a solver like https://tum-csc.github.io/c43d/) , but it is quite cumbersome. So I'm not planning to do it now. **Hope someone will do it.**
