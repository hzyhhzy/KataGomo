# This folder include training scripts which were actually used in the latest run

**The parameters in these scripts is what I used at the END of the training. You should change -lr-scale before using these scripts**   
-lr-scale is in run_train.sh or train/train.sh. If -lr-scale is in both files, the one in run_train.sh will override train/train.sh  
-lr-scale 2.0 is good for beginning
